### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

**I code for a living, believe it or not.**   

Iâ€™m currently working with Reactjs and Vuejs creating awesome, breathtaking, magnificent, stunning, beyond belief apps. Also, I recently fell in love with Swift.   
Fun not so fun fact, I love music and playing BASS.   

Looking to collaborate on PWAs as mobile apps projects.
